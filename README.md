# Logic-based Linguistic Compression Engine
**Minimalist, Explainable, and Efficient AI for Contextual Understanding.**

## Core Philosophy
Traditional AI relies on massive statistical models (LLMs) to predict the next word, often leading to "black box" decisions, high computational costs, and conversational misinterpretations. This project takes a different path: **Deterministic Logical Abstraction.**

By codifying the structural and cognitive rules of language into a lightweight engine, we achieve human-level contextual reasoning with a fraction of the memory and processing power.

## Key Pillars
1. **Explainability (Transparent Reasoning)**:

   Every inference step is driven by clear, rule-based logic. You can trace exactly why the AI interpreted a sentence a certain way.
   
2. **Extreme Efficiency**:

   Our engine performs inference via logic, not massive matrix multiplication. It is designed to run on low-cost hardware, from home appliances to embedded systems.

3. **Language Agnostic Structure**:

   The logical core (Subject Inference, Semantic Categorization) is designed to be applicable across multiple languages, including Japanese and English.

## The 5-Stage Logical Pipeline
Our engine processes language through a bottom-up logical hierarchy:

- Stage 1: Subject Inference (Resolving implicit subjects using psychological verb patterns)
- Stage 2: Clarification Request (Deterministic handling of ambiguous inputs)
- Stage 3: Context & Causality Inference (Mapping evidentiality markers to logical sources)
- Stage 4: Modification Clarification (Resolving nested clause structures)
- Stage 5: Argument Mapping (Precise assignment of case relationships)

## Example: Logical Inference vs. Probabilistic Guessing
Our engine avoids errors by using structural overrides instead of statistical weightings.

| Input | Logic Process | Result |
|--|--|--|
| "Thought it was strange." | Psychological Verb + Null Subject → [Default: Speaker] | AI correctly identifies "I". |
| "Thought it was strange, apparently." | Psychological Verb + Evidential Marker → [Override: 3rd Party] | AI identifies the agent as a 3rd party. |

In the second case, the "Evidential Marker" (⁠apparently⁠) acts as a logical trigger to override the default speaker-centric perspective. This deterministic logic ensures precision that probabilistic models often miss.

## Approach

The system adopts a staged improvement model, including:
	
	•	Clarification of contextual assumptions
	•	Minimal and strategic clarification questions
	•	Causal relationship inference
	•	Structural and grammatical dependency analysis
	•	Final intent determination

This approach complements traditional NLP techniques while improving
semantic and grammatical understanding.
